# Object-Detection-Instance-Segmentation-with-YOLOv8
## **Project Summary**
In this project, I used **YOLOv8** for:
- **Object Detection**: Detecting plastic, paper, and metal in trash images
- **Instance Segmentation**: Segmenting healthy plant leaves from disease datasets
This involved **training models**, evaluating performance with **mAP metrics**, and visualizing predictions with bounding boxes and masks.
## Evaluation
- Segmentation on healthy leaves with moderate accuracy
- Mask overlay drawn correctly
- Confidence ~0.84
## Observations
- Label misclassified due to leaf looking diseased
- Only one class limited accuracy
- More data or stronger model (like yolov8m-seg) needed
